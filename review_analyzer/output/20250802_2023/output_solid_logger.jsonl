It offers relatively solid fighting/movement mechanics with interesting mobs and very exciting bosses. Character customization is also incredibly high (for what the game is) giving you plenty of different pixels for your sprite character. Music is catchy, and will not cause ear bleeds, though I prefer my own tunes. Best of all, the team behind this game has a very good sense of humor and have provided many references to other games, and 'Easter eggs' to find. Better with friends, but hey, most games are.\n\n\n-Personal Experience-\n\nAt first this game was fun, there is no denying that. I hopped on, got a server going (somehow) and played with my good friend Michael for about 100 hours. Exploring this game and all it had to offer was really something, I mean it was like Minecraft just with something more, special, about it. Trying really hard on bosses, (that were really challenging) and the like, using superior teamwork and strats to finally complete the game.\n\nThe problem with 1.0 is that it had trouble maintaining interest endgame. Sure it was fun to jump around the surface in all your gear killing slimes and building uninteresting houses over and over. However after a while this gets tiring, which is why I was extremely thankful for the 1.1 update.\n\n1.1 Hardmode, awww yisss. Hardmode was fun, suddenly all of your top gear was suddenly worthless (almost) and you had to re-explore the game again. Albeit upgrading all the bosses and adding the new zone was really cool, it didn't hold my attention as long and I kind of forgot about it and moved on to playing other games.\n\nI stayed inactive in Terraria for most of 1.2 occasionally hopping on with a couple of friends to do a challenge run or something. We would usually get bored half way through which means I never got to experience anything that was added after 1.2. At least, until recently.\n\nA little after 1.2.4, on a cold stormy night (or something like that) my good friend asked me if I wanted to play Terraria again. We've played before and it was okay but never really something that got me hooked. Luckily for me, I recently ran out of games I was interested in playing at the moment. So that left Terraria, so I agreed and we started playing. After the long trek through most of the normal gearing, and some of the hardmode gearing something amazing happened. I found this game fun again.\n\n1.2.4, was amazing. It was admittedly shorter than the other two (in terms of how long I played it for) but those short hours were exceedingly fun, fun enough to warrant buying this game several times over. I had a blast fighting all the new bosses with their interesting and unique mechanics and boy was Fishron a pain in the ass, but hey, after 30 or 40 attempts at his life I beat him, and the endgame gearing started again from there.\n\nAround this time I developed a new sort of appreciation for this game. The kind you get after playing a game for years. It became a classic for me, something that was a (noticeable) chuck of my life. Definitely something that made the gamer that is myself today. \n\nAt the end of it all, it left me with a strong feeling of wanting more. I did go around and play some other games that are very similar to this game in playstyle, but nothing really came close to providing the same experience this game did, and for that I thank you Terraria. I will for sure be waiting anxiously for the release of Terraria 1.3. Whether I update my review after that remains to be unknown...\n\n*= 1.3 Update =*\n\n1.3 came out for Terraria and I was extatic, unfortunately I was unable to play it for a couple months, however when I finally did I had a blast working my way through the game on expert mode, which was a nice change of pace, and almost revived the feelings I had when I first played and every boss was really challenging. \n\nDespite everything being challenging a couple of friends and I got through the pre 1.3 relatively quickly so there weren't any boring moments. Then came the anticipated 1.3 gameplay, and I have to say the last boss was super challenging for us, and we finally managed to best it after a couple tries. \n\nThat being said it felt like there was surprisingly little update compared to the last two, which is understandable considering the focus of 1.3 was to improve a lot of the gameplay and inner works of the game than to add more content. The introduction of yoyo's was a really cool idea though, and I think they did a good job of introducing this new theme without it impeding on what the game already was. \n\nAlthough I think 1.3 might be the last major content update, I'm still wanting more, I personally would like to fight cthulu as a whole, that would be amurzin. For now, I'll just build around, mess with the new building items and such until I eventually move on to other games, until the fateful day Terraria lures me back into its grasp, or perhaps Terraria 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n**= Old review =**\n\nI have mixed feelings about this game. Its unusual. Fun, oh yes, it is completely awesome. Just? What the fuck do we do, after we have everything? There is no endgame (that was a complete lie there are three end game places you can go to the hellworld the dungeon and the jungle). But besides that, It dosn't really work as a building game, making the actual \"end-game\" not all the fun. \n\nIm giving it a steady 7 - 10..."}

Much, much more awaits on this piece of art. And if you're still asking yourself that question, I'll save you the time and go ahead and answer it: Yes, it blends."}

So, after a friend convinced me to check it out, I bought a 4 pack to play with friends. I was really hyped and thought it would be just like Minecraft and in some ways, it's quite similar.\n\nWhat I like most about Terraria is how it's more combat focused. You have a huge variety of weapons, accessories (almost every accessory is different than the last. From your simple ones to help restore health and mana quicker, to ones that let you double jump, or to warp to your spawn point, the list goes on and on) and even armor, with a lot of vanity items. I like how the tiers actually make you feel like you're progressing in the game, instead of it simply being easier. As soon as you 'unlock' the next tier, it usually comes with harder enemies and bosses to keep the game challenging and fresh. (besides tiers below gold/platinum, but to be fair, without gold/platinum tiered items, the beginning enemies are still a challenge) \n\nWhile there isn't much reason to build anything other than a mansion/village for the pretty big amount of NPCs that can and will move in, you still have that option to be creative. The biomes are different enough that, even though your world isn't \"infinite\", you'll still have a blast exploring your entire world. Once you unlock hard-mode, you get additional biomes and every current biome will have harder enemies. Thankfully, usually only at night or underground.\n\nSo, if you have somehow avoided this game after it has been out for 4 years, I definitely think you should pick this gem up, with how cheap it is and how often the game goes on sale, (I think it's safe to say at least 3 times a year) I think it's okay to assume you won't be disappointed.\n\nOne last thing, the game does have PvP and even a game-mode designed for it... However I've never played PvP and can't say how it is."}

But the more you play, the more you realize it's less about building and more about exploring the gigantic caves (Makes Minecraft caves look incredibly small) and fighting off monsters. It's more about building up your character, getting bigger and better weapons, armor, ect, because you can use the same character in different singleplayer worlds and different multiplayer servers.\n\nIt's like Castlevania, Metroid, and other platformers with a bit of Minecraft in it. All in all a great game. You should buy it."}

This game is in a way like a 2D minecraft in the fact that you can use a pick to dig and an axe to cut trees. You can also find similarities in  the resources you find. This is really where it stops being a 2D minecraft clone and starts to become its own game. Where minecraft focuses heavily on building and collecting esources, terraria focuses on surviving and exploring. The mobs in terraria are relentless and will hunt you down. There are many types of mobs as well, not just a handful. There are cave systems in terraria similar to minecraft but you can find A LOT more stuff such as mobs, powerups to your character, and much better resources. The crafting in the game is large as well. You start with the basics and then you must work your way to the better items.There are tons of more things but I have reached the limit. PM me for more. Basically get the game it is cheap and worth it."}
