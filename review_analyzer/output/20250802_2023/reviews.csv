105600;916145;This is one of the best Sandbox/Adventure games I've ever played. It's simply fantastic. The randomly generated worlds can be shaped at your leisure . You can build a magnificient castle on the surface, or an underground lair. There's bosses to fight, dungeons to explore, treasure to find in the caves, and even a hidden jungle deep in the underground. You can even visit the underworld. And you can do it all with up to 8 players in multiplayer. There's even PvP gameplay if you want. It's great fun tearing one of the bosses up with friends. And you get free content updates for life when you spend your $10 on this. I can think of no better game at this price.;

Edit:
Great updates came!";
105600;1605013;"[i]Terraria[/i] is a straight-up ugly 2D sandbox game, full of too much randomly-generated junk and not nearly enough fun. I played it for 30 hours, but I don't think it ever really held my attention. Most ""adventure builder"" games make you rack up an assload of unnecessary playtime as you hunt for basic resources and tediously comb through pages of craftables, all while dealing with the game's utterly arcane mechanics; [i]Terraria[/i] is no exception. Combat never gets fun. Building your humble abode is an okay experience, but at the end of the day I didn't care about my home or my things; I just wanted to stop. I was tired of the headache-inducing visuals, ugly lighting, and hard to read pixels.

I genuinely dislike this game's look. Every sprite is so amateur, full of poor color choices/bad color ramps. It's looked like this forever, and I've never liked it. I unabashedly love pixels, but this stuff is unreadable junk nearly all the time. Rotating pixels on an axis to swing a weapon (instead of creating real character animations) looks genuinely awful. Nothing has any weight. Glowing particle effects are used everywhere instead of actual effect animation. Red, yellow, orange particles for fire. Green particles for spells. When combat gets intense, [i]Terraria[/i] is a [i]chore[/i] to look at.

I get that the devs love to make it, but I sure as heck don't like to play it.";

Terraria is a game for those who love to explore.  You will always find yourself wondering, ""what is just beyond this wall of dirt and rock? What is just out of sight? And you will dig some more, and maybe find a cavern or a treasure chest or some valuable ore or... death. And pretty soon, you will be hooked.

Terraria is also a game with therapeutic potential. Sure, anyone can build a shelter to protect them from monsters in a matter of seconds. In a minute or so, they can make one that meets the bare minimum requirements for attracting useful NPC vendors. What you may find yourself doing, however, is spending nearly an hour making yourself a picturesque little villa worth taking a screenshot of for your friend";

I don't think I can think of an element of the game that is bad, from the soundtrack to the art of sprites, mechanics and the wide variety of weapons, armor, equipment, vanity items, building blocks so many you always discover a new one you didn't think existed before. Events, amazing biomes and world generation and exploration, pyramids, caves, undiscovered shrines and floating islands... I'm getting excited just by writing about it.

There is not a single person I wouldn't recommend this game to, specially with the low price and the constant sales it gets.

A superb sandbox game. Those familiar with Minecraft will probably want to check it out, and the same can be said to those unfamiliar with it. There is so much to do in Terraria! You can build and craft almost anything while fighting hordes of goblins or pesky slimes, explore a huge map with various biomes (environment specific areas, ranging from deserts to underground jungle or corrupted lands to forests) and epic boss fights every now and then with the numerous weapons you can create. A very charming game, it also includes a full multiplayer mode for co-op adventuring and building or intense PVP battles.

Ever since, the game has received a ton of content updates, all of which were delivered at no cost to the players. Compared to where it started, back when Hellstone was the endgame ore, the game has at least four times the amount of content and that's probably still selling it low. It partnered with a lot of games for crossovers, adding a bunch of flavor items that feel like they belong in the game and further improve the fun factor. 

A lovely and memorable soundtrack with (maybe not breathtaking, but still) pleasant pixel graphics. Dozens of viable character builds, lots of replayability and a modding scene. Tiny download, should run on pretty much anything.

Never thought I'd have so much fun exploring such a simple world.

Nov. 2017
I just got back into playing this game again since five years back, and the game plays even better than before. There's so much more content, and I've just barely scratched the surface on this game.

Pros: 
+Lots of items to craft
+More ways to build
+Plenty of variety
+Events to keep the game interesting
+Expert mode is a good change of pace
+More game mechanics to fiddle around with

Cons:
-Although this is a sandbox game, one cannot go straight to the final boss, or whatever boss fight they choose. There are ""tiers"" in which some bosses must be taken down in order.
-No free mode for creative players to focus on purely building and crafting
-Events can get in the way while one is in the middle of construction.
-Enemy AI still gets stuck behind walls when there are clear visible paths to get to the player.

Terraria is a blast to play, and it certainly exceeded expectations since the last time I played it. Although I recommended this game when it was just starting out, not much more needs to be said now that many others have already given this game the thumbs up.";

105600;3091817;"*= I'm going to give this another review after the 1.1 & 1.2 update for Terraria. =*

-Core Review-

Gameplay . 7 (with friends 9) = average 8
Music . 7
Art . 7
Mechanics . 8

Total . 7.5/10


-Nice Words-

If you like building, and platformers with a very arcade feel then this already may be just the game for you. It offers relatively solid fighting/movement mechanics with interesting mobs and very exciting bosses. Character customization is also incredibly high (for what the game is) giving you plenty of different pixels for your sprite character. Music is catchy, and will not cause ear bleeds, though I prefer my own tunes. Best of all, the team behind this game has a very good sense of humor and have provided many references to other games, and 'Easter eggs' to find. Better with friends, but hey, most games are.


-Personal Experience-

At first this game was fun, there is no denying that. I hopped on, got a server going (somehow) and played with my good friend Michael for about 100 hours. Exploring this game and all it had to offer was really something, I mean it was like Minecraft just with something more, special, about it. Trying really hard on bosses, (that were really challenging) and the like, using superior teamwork and strats to finally complete the game.

The problem with 1.0 is that it had trouble maintaining interest endgame. Sure it was fun to jump around the surface in all your gear killing slimes and building uninteresting houses over and over. However after a while this gets tiring, which is why I was extremely thankful for the 1.1 update.

1.1 Hardmode, awww yisss. Hardmode was fun, suddenly all of your top gear was suddenly worthless (almost) and you had to re-explore the game again. Albeit upgrading all the bosses and adding the new zone was really cool, it didn't hold my attention as long and I kind of forgot about it and moved on to playing other games.

I stayed inactive in Terraria for most of 1.2 occasionally hopping on with a couple of friends to do a challenge run or something. We would usually get bored half way through which means I never got to experience anything that was added after 1.2. At least, until recently.

A little after 1.2.4, on a cold stormy night (or something like that) my good friend asked me if I wanted to play Terraria again. We've played before and it was okay but never really something that got me hooked. Luckily for me, I recently ran out of games I was interested in playing at the moment. So that left Terraria, so I agreed and we started playing. After the long trek through most of the normal gearing, and some of the hardmode gearing something amazing happened. I found this game fun again.

1.2.4, was amazing. It was admittedly shorter than the other two (in terms of how long I played it for) but those short hours were exceedingly fun, fun enough to warrant buying this game several times over. I had a blast fighting all the new bosses with their interesting and unique mechanics and boy was Fishron a pain in the ass, but hey, after 30 or 40 attempts at his life I beat him, and the endgame gearing started again from there.

Around this time I developed a new sort of appreciation for this game. The kind you get after playing a game for years. It became a classic for me, something that was a (noticeable) chuck of my life. Definitely something that made the gamer that is myself today. 

At the end of it all, it left me with a strong feeling of wanting more. I did go around and play some other games that are very similar to this game in playstyle, but nothing really came close to providing the same experience this game did, and for that I thank you Terraria. I will for sure be waiting anxiously for the release of Terraria 1.3. Whether I update my review after that remains to be unknown...

*= 1.3 Update =*

1.3 came out for Terraria and I was extatic, unfortunately I was unable to play it for a couple months, however when I finally did I had a blast working my way through the game on expert mode, which was a nice change of pace, and almost revived the feelings I had when I first played and every boss was really challenging. 

Despite everything being challenging a couple of friends and I got through the pre 1.3 relatively quickly so there weren't any boring moments. Then came the anticipated 1.3 gameplay, and I have to say the last boss was super challenging for us, and we finally managed to best it after a couple tries. 

That being said it felt like there was surprisingly little update compared to the last two, which is understandable considering the focus of 1.3 was to improve a lot of the gameplay and inner works of the game than to add more content. The introduction of yoyo's was a really cool idea though, and I think they did a good job of introducing this new theme without it impeding on what the game already was. 

Although I think 1.3 might be the last major content update, I'm still wanting more, I personally would like to fight cthulu as a whole, that would be amurzin. For now, I'll just build around, mess with the new building items and such until I eventually move on to other games, until the fateful day Terraria lures me back into its grasp, or perhaps Terraria 2.





**= Old review =**

I have mixed feelings about this game. Its unusual. Fun, oh yes, it is completely awesome. Just? What the fuck do we do, after we have everything? There is no endgame (that was a complete lie there are three end game places you can go to the hellworld the dungeon and the jungle). But besides that, It dosn't really work as a building game, making the actual ""end-game"" not all the fun. 

Im giving it a steady 7 - 10...";

105600;716723;Not just a Minecraft clone, but a game in its own right. As opposed to Minecraft's focus on building, Terraria utilises the same exploration for resources so you can explore further and deeper into a very difficult, dangerous world. Great multiplayer!;

105600;714880;I was pleasantly surprised by Terraria.  This 2D adventure/building/mining game is set in huge, randomly-generated worlds (hence all the Minecraft comparisons), but it stands on its own and contains quite a few new ideas to boot.  It can be a little unforgiving early on, but your character (and his/her inventory) carries over to new worlds.  I've only played for a little while, but it's addictive as hell and the multiplayer promises to compound that fun quite a bit.  Pick this one up.;

105600;996410;Terraria has the feeling of a wonderfully open-world classic 8-bit adventure game.  You have a lot of freedom to create, a lot of exciting exploration, and its easy to port-forward and set up a server for your friends.  One of the greatest things in Terraria is to see what other people decide to add to the world.  Another great thing is exploring the boundaries of the randomly generated world, and being rewarded for it.  Although beating the bosses requires some exceptional equipment and preparation, there is almost nothing you will decide to do that you will regret in this game.  Dying has the unhappy disadvantage of dropping half your money, but you don't drop equipment, and your money will stay where you died unless you quit (or your server quits).  Overall, I think it's a shame more games with such excellent game design don't come out.  Come on, would you rather be blowing up evil alien robots with weapons of mass destruction, or digging?  The choice seems obvious to me.;
105600;4802533;This game carries. Logged 18 hours in 2 days its amazing just shut the fuck up and buy it;
105600;674256;"Hmm where do I start? Having played a lot of Minecraft I can draw a lot of similarities and differences between the two. In short, if you’ve played Minecraft and would enjoy a more involved co-op experience along with a PvE aspect to the game then Terraria is not a bad choice especially for the price range it resides in. Also, your Terraria character can be brought to any world with all stats and inventory intact which is a nice feature for adventuring solo and also with buddies down the road.

There’s just so much more to do in Terraria. I like how they’ve tiered the content by having you get or make the proper equipment, tools, and npcs before heading to the next tier. Some interesting things are making rooms fitting a certain criteria for npcs to spawn and the boatload of items with awesome effects.";

The game was good when it released.  Since then, it has received some major content patches and the game has only gotten better really.  There are a lot more things to find and environments to explore than there were originally.

Really the only thing hampering this game is its lack of integration of Steam features such as achievements and the workshop.  But that in no way makes for a dull game experience.";

105600;2823938;"Despite not having nearly as many 'Steam' hours as some of the other reviewers here, I believe that my say as someone whom has had the opportunity to watch (and play) Terraria ever since the leak of it's alpha back in 2011- that hands down, the experience Terraria brings to the table, is much more satisfying and consistant than any other title I've touched. 

Core Gameplay: 10/10- ""Core"" meaning the progression through different 'stages' within the game. There's literally no set boundaries for beating Terraria, which in my opinion, gives way to near-inifinite replayability. If you want to skip an early boss or two, fine by Terraria- If you don't want to bother collecting any specific ore for it's respective armor, Terraria wont hold it against you- This is a game that you could do nothing but build, and still have hundreds of hours of gameplay.

Edit: To add to my review. Content has been updated and to the extent that the original game is just a small part of the much larger picture now. The game developers have consistently patched this game with not only bug fixes but huge amount of additional content that most other game companies would sell as add-on packs or DLCs.

105600;3571212;"Terraria is a strange and pleasing indie RPG game that offers wide, divese and almost limitless gameplay possibilities within reason.

Terraria is most commonly compared to the game Minecraft, this in my opinion is fairly correct as Terraria has taken certain influence from Minecraft yet altered it to make Terraria it’s own unique game. 

They have retro stylised the game with 2D features. It supports an atmospheric upbeat tempo and feel during the day, and a sinister and dark atmosphere at night. Been able to battle boss enemies makes the game much better as well as harder.

Terraria is huge and vast even with small map, but at the start you may feel overwhelmed especially if this is your first time playing a game of this type. The main two problems, listed below:

- Laggy and somewhat strange enemy lag online sometimes gets me annoyed.
- Load time, even with a fast computer deter you from just jumping in, jumping out

November 2016 Update:
----------------------------------

I can't remember how much I paid for this back in 2011 shortly after it first launched. It may have been ""as much"" as $15. I never would have thought that five years later it would still be receiving (free!) updates.

I currently have about 625 hours of playtime logged, and with my ~$15 spent to buy the game, that works out to over 40 hours per dollar spent. Or $0.025 (that's two and a half cents) per hour of entertainment. I expect my playtime will increase in the future, leading to even greater value.

Great, great value. And a very fun game.

May 2011 Review:
---------------------------------

Combine the adventure of a ""Metroidvania"" with the randomly generated free-form sandbox of Minecraft and that somewhat describes Terraria. It's a great adventure platformer with the optional freedom to creatively build and shape your world if that suits your desires.";

105600;914344;Take Minecraft, make it 2 dimensional. Then add crazy weapons and boss battles that you can experience with lots of friends. I've clocked nearly 100 hours into this game in it's first week that it's been available and it's not been boring at all. What to do when you're alone? Dig, build, mess around, but mostly dig around a lot. What's really great is getting together with friends to fight the bosses and explore these randomized worlds. There's so much more you can do in this game when playing with friends. When you reach the Underworld locations, trying to mine up that Hellstone Ore, you'll wish you had someone watching your back when you've got giant Bone Serpents and Fire Imps attacking you while you are jumping across pits of lava.;

105600;4582333;awesome;
105600;1757352;"lol i looked at my review for this game from 2011 and I was selling it so short back then.

The devs' devotion is absolutely baffling in the best way possible. there's been so much work done, content added and everything fleshed out to make this one of the most challenging, engaging, and deep crafting/exploration games i've ever played. But it's still incredibly accessible without ever needing to look at a wiki, and with wonderful, semi-granular difficulty levels so that all skill levels can have a good time. And if you have a creative side, the amount of decorative blocks, furniture, wallpapers, and other things is just wonderful to play around with!

Special shoutout to the Journey mode, which is basically ""creative, but with compelling reasons to actually play the game, too"". Having to unlock each block type before getting to use unlimited amounts of it is an absolutely genius idea, giving you the freedom to build some extremely cool stuff without making it a completely game-less sandbox.

Probably one of the best games on steam, you should definitely buy it if you think you might like it.";

105600;2567646;This has to be one of the best Indie games I have ever played. Hands down. Better than Minecraft!;

A single torch on the wall now decrease your luck by as much as 50% (has effect on droprates, defense, damage). A torch. You know, the thing you use to see in the pitch black darkness of 90% of the map.
Know what the best part is? This new mechanic tanks the FPS on weaker computers, because it checks for torches in a wide range around the player for every tick.
Fishing and weapons and everything in between has been nerfed.
The NPCs now have autistic preferences for what houses they like to live in, so everything is much more expensive if you don't build tiny houses spread all over the map.
Corruption still ruins jungles and the new mounts are locked to master mode.

Oh, but there's golf now.

If you really want to get the most from this i'd recommend that you initially resist the temptation to just look up a wiki and instead rely on experimentation to make progress and find cool stuff.

Multiplayer (at time of writing) still has a few kinks to work out, but is a huge amount of fun! [The game is ripe for griefing - only play with trusted friends!]";

The game also gives you lots of good reasons to go out and fight monsters, besides all of the awesome loot that they'll drop, there's also a wider variety of monsters, and there's even boss monsters.

Between that & the townspeople, It gives you a goal in an otherwise open-ended game, and gives the whole thing a lot more structure than something like Minecraft, highly reccomended to anybody, especially fans of Minecraft.";

105600;2341529;wiki videogame;
105600;4117464;"Absolutely wonderful game! This is not the ""2D Minecraft"", this is something way different. Minecraft is more building based, Terraria however focuses on combat and gear mechanics, offering an innumerable amount interesting items and cool enemies and boss battles. And of course you can build stuff, if you like doing that (I personally am more the ""hack and slash through the game and be done with it"" type, sometimes adventuring depending on how interesting it will be)

Terraria has a day/night cycle with events such as ""Blood moon"" during which there will be more enemies and they can break through doors. After advancing far enough in the game, you'll find that beating a certain boss changes the game to ""hardmode"". Stronger enemies, better items, LOTS AND LOTS of more interesting items and some HM(hardmode) only events and NPC's.

Unlike Minecraft, there is a Guide in this game, though he is hated by the community due to his uselessness. In other words, Terraria is alike in the aspect that to find out how something works or what to do in situation x, you need to google. I don't think that is a bad thing though.";
105600;4667999;Terraria is still an amazing game and despite the fact that I am a little late on Hard Mode, I still have lots of fun and am currently looking forward towards the 1.3 update!;

105600;2580293;"Terraria is typically labelled as a 2D clone of Minecraft's. While it certainly shares some very similar creative elements, Terraria is an entirely different game.

I'd definately reccomend it to anyone, certainly for the price it's at aswell. Ofcourse it's better with friends too :)";
105600;559804;This beats Minecraft by a long shot. Many items added every week or so. Tons of different possibilities.

105600;2491480;"Well, folks. It's been over a decade since I first purchased Terraria. Never have I ever been treated to such a wonderful journey before. Non-stop, FREE, updates for a third of my life. The game was already a god-send when it first released. Now? It will be a game of legend forevermore. If I were to be locked away, or left on an island, and could only have one video game to play until my end of days... I would choose Terraria. The final updates have rounded out my personal choice for Best Game of All-time. I'm starting a new save file and going through from beginning to end again. With all the new additions, balances, expansions, and more. I plan to sink another 500 hours into this game, making it the first title I'll have 1000 hours in. Terraria has been with me through three relationships, going back to school, several job changes, and a lot of personal growth. This is my diamond in the rough, and I'd never want to change a thing.

Endless thanks to Re-Logic. You've achieved more than most developers could even dream of. My hat is off to each and every one of you. I could honestly cry. What a masterpiece you've made.";

105600;419929;Simple premise that proves tougher than you would think, yet is horribly addictive.  Huge random proceedurally generated worlds, hundreds of recipies for items ranging from torches to magic weapons/armor, Metroidvania style combat = a good time!;
105600;611410;Amazingly fun for a 2d, pixelated game.. Nostalgiac, in some ways. The most fun will come from playing with a group of friends, exploring, fighting and building. I also recommend avoiding the use of wiki for at least a few days and trying to learn as you go. The game will last much longer if you do so.;
105600;633235;I hate to say it, but this game is fairly addictive.  I love the fact that its a cheesier old looking game, but the mechanics of the game are quite complex.  Its the SNES rpg we never had when we were younger, and the multiplayer is also an awesome feature.;

105600;518210;"It's -very- similar to Minecraft and yet it isn't. It's like Zelda and Minecraft combined in a fun little game about exploration, getting better items and levelling up.

Best 10 bucks I've spent on steam in quite a while :)";
105600;66825;2D mincraft is a good reference point, but doesn't nearly do justice to this game.  Many of the same threads of minecraft are present but many of the downsides are not.  lighter weight more forgiving construction and overhead is only the start.  The number of items you can craft and thier usefulness is vastly superior in terraria.  Can you say rocket boots, yes thats right, later in the game you can get rocket boots... and fly.  combat is a big part of terraria as well including many large bosses (see the trailer) that are remenicent of old school NES games such as zelda, ghouls and goblins, and castlevania.  I really can't say enough good things about this game and at only a few dollars its hard to say no to.  happy hunting;
105600;4667319;Terraria > Minecraft;

Why would I stay up so late? Oh.. Killing skeletor with my motley crew of friends with a ball and chain, fire flower, and various other sundry items of slaughter. After that we plowed through a massive dungeon and found delicious loot! I needed a gunsmith for my new weapon however, so I went back to my world and singlehandedly destroyed eater of worlds in a storm of bullets.

This game, is the best 10 dollars I have ever spent on anything. It is the most satisfying experience when it comes to fighting / building / exploring since minecraft, and I might even suggest it is as good, if not better when it comes to fast paced, cooperative teamwork.

The persistant items might make multiplayer a faceroll if a higher level person comes in, but endgame is challenging regardless of how much badass stuff you have. It 'caps' if you will, so even your copper sword will help somehow.

Overall, despite the fact that there are so many haters and people that compare it to minecraft, it is something completely different to every game I have ever played. You should really pick it up and play it for a few pounds, and I can guarantee you that at least some enjoyment will come out of it.;
105600;769899;Not just a Minecraft in 2d.  This is more then that.  It's more focused on fighting then Minecraft is.  If anything, it's more akin to a platformer then to Minecraft.  There are, of course, similarities.  Both authors agree to this without question.  However, pretty much anything that uses blocks and or a mining pick is going to be called a Minecraft clone from here on out by default :);

Awesome game! Totally recommend getting this game!";
105600;2920047;This is a great game, must have if you like sandbox games!;
105600;750595;Best game ever made. Combat, crafting, exploration, ridiculous amount of content, great multiplayer, great sense of progression and different goals and game mechanics throughout the course of the game.;
105600;1367705;Very fun game, it's pretty similar to minecraft but not a rip-off. Theres more fighting and actual survival involved as compared to minecraft though so if you're coming in as a minecraft player don't think you can just sit back mining away into the oblivion without any trouble, you'll constantly be fighting off enemies that will spawn around you (even in the light) and trying to avoid falling to your death and raging pools of lava. Theres plenty of different areas to explore and items to find even NOW (which theres plans to add more over time) that will keep you busy for a good while. Being 2D, there IS limits to building as opposed to minecraft so I wouldn't say building is this games strong point, however it is still something necessary and you CAN have fun with it if you can be creative with building in 2D. You can still make huge fortresses, towers, castles, houses, ETC. It's is half the price of MC so if you're going to pick that up, go ahead and grab this too!;
105600;452984;Get this game now! Do it, quickly. It is awesome!;
105600;4809893;Not a bad game!;
105600;1956802;Let's not kid ourselves. This is 2D, sidescrolling MINECRAFT. With that said... this reimagined ripoff does a few things better than the original. There're TONS of different kinds of items to play with. The crafting recipes are a simple click of the mouse... so long as you have the required ingredients at hand. I could go on... but I've got some two-dimensional mining to do.;
105600;3755881;Terraria is really freaking good...buy it already;

It has changed immensely since it was launched, with perhaps three times the amount of content being added.

...what happened?";
105600;1857998;"This game is the bomb!  It's so addictive.  It has a lot of similarities to Minecraft but it's so much better.  Items are persistant cross server and single player, so you can really build up a wealth.  Unlike MC, when you die, you don't pop and lose your whole life's work.  Definitely better with friends.  I'm hooked.  Think Super Mario World + Zelda: Link to the Past + Minecraft + originality.  That's this game.  5/5

EDIT 2021:  This game still keeps getting better.  I know they're ""done"" updating it but they've said that before and they still kept going.

105600;1520379;An excellent combination of exploration, adventure, and RPG elements. Random level generation guarantees a decent amount of replay ability (that and the lack of any linear gameplay or story). Though possible, there's little need to make multiple characters. The same character (and all its equipment) can be used from any one single or multiplayer map to the next. The fun gameplay is only magnified by solid multiplayer.

New blocks, including clouds and clouds that rain.";
105600;3967832;While this game has lost it's flare for me since release (which is to be expected), it is a great game for new or returning players. Some new updates have come out but as of recently none have come out. I played it avadly when first released but as time went on less and less time was spent playing it. Just like it's 3d likness Minecraft the gameplay can get repetive and boring when played for too long. Worth the money though, just split up your time playing and you'll never get board.;
105600;1861859;2D Minecraft but with action rpg elements like loot, gear and lots of different monsters. Great game for multiplayer!;
105600;3638375;Pretty Amazing if you like Minecraft. NOT A CLONE;
105600;915485;Terraria is essentially a 2d minecraft with emphasis on combat and adventuring rather than building.  The building aspect is still there, but the amount of unique items, weapons, etc that can be found by exploring and killing monsters makes fighting more fun than building.  Building is still in the game, and you are actually rewarded for constructing buildings as NPCs will move in who sell different items.  The combat and fighting are very similar to many old school side scrolling games like metroid or contra which is pretty sweet.  Eventually as you dig deeper the enemies get stronger and boss monsters appear, which of course means better items for you.  If you like minecraft, but don't liike how there wasn't really any reward for going out and exploring and fighting, i would give this game a try.;

105600;1052382;"Lets get this out of the way: Yes, its like minecraft. That's not a bad thing. Especially becuase this game is different enough to stand on its own merits.

The 2D is a pretty cool take on mining and building, and the multiplayer is a blast and a bit more functional than Minecraft even. Add in the planned post-launch feature updates the devs have mentioned and I'd say this is worth the price of admission.";
105600;4518352;The easy way to describe this game is Minecraft in 2D. But apart from missing a dimension it has a lot different. Boss battles, loot, artifact items that give you powers e.g. double jump, but most importantly is the crafting!

It's far from it, trust me. For one, there's thousands of more things to do. You can also play multiplayer with your friends, for even more fun. Anyhow... I'd easily give this game an...

105600;1019177;"After playing the game on and off for the last 4 years, I think Terraria deserves an actual review from me.

When I first heard of this game, it wasn't long after I really got into Minecraft. So, after a friend convinced me to check it out, I bought a 4 pack to play with friends. I was really hyped and thought it would be just like Minecraft and in some ways, it's quite similar.

What I like most about Terraria is how it's more combat focused. You have a huge variety of weapons, accessories (almost every accessory is different than the last. From your simple ones to help restore health and mana quicker, to ones that let you double jump, or to warp to your spawn point, the list goes on and on) and even armor, with a lot of vanity items. I like how the tiers actually make you feel like you're progressing in the game, instead of it simply being easier. As soon as you 'unlock' the next tier, it usually comes with harder enemies and bosses to keep the game challenging and fresh. (besides tiers below gold/platinum, but to be fair, without gold/platinum tiered items, the beginning enemies are still a challenge) 

While there isn't much reason to build anything other than a mansion/village for the pretty big amount of NPCs that can and will move in, you still have that option to be creative. The biomes are different enough that, even though your world isn't ""infinite"", you'll still have a blast exploring your entire world. Once you unlock hard-mode, you get additional biomes and every current biome will have harder enemies. Thankfully, usually only at night or underground.

So, if you have somehow avoided this game after it has been out for 4 years, I definitely think you should pick this gem up, with how cheap it is and how often the game goes on sale, (I think it's safe to say at least 3 times a year) I think it's okay to assume you won't be disappointed.

One last thing, the game does have PvP and even a game-mode designed for it... However I've never played PvP and can't say how it is.";
105600;859473;So full of imaginaaation! I fully recommend this to all and everyone that like to build from their own mind, or just slash the heck out of giant skeletons and wurms!;
105600;4419521;Once you get the hang of it, which takes a good hour, this is uber addictive. The first time I played it, i played it for 6 hours straight. I never play anything longer than 2 hours in one sitting. Impressive!;

You'd think it's a 2D Minecraft - and I did too when I first started playing it. But the more you play, the more you realize it's less about building and more about exploring the gigantic caves (Makes Minecraft caves look incredibly small) and fighting off monsters. It's more about building up your character, getting bigger and better weapons, armor, ect, because you can use the same character in different singleplayer worlds and different multiplayer servers.

It's like Castlevania, Metroid, and other platformers with a bit of Minecraft in it. All in all a great game. You should buy it.";

105600;4024171;I have to make the comparison to minecraft because most have either played it or have heard of it. This game is in a way like a 2D minecraft in the fact that you can use a pick to dig and an axe to cut trees. You can also find similarities in  the resources you find. This is really where it stops being a 2D minecraft clone and starts to become its own game. Where minecraft focuses heavily on building and collecting esources, terraria focuses on surviving and exploring. The mobs in terraria are relentless and will hunt you down. There are many types of mobs as well, not just a handful. There are cave systems in terraria similar to minecraft but you can find A LOT more stuff such as mobs, powerups to your character, and much better resources. The crafting in the game is large as well. You start with the basics and then you must work your way to the better items.There are tons of more things but I have reached the limit. PM me for more. Basically get the game it is cheap and worth it.;
