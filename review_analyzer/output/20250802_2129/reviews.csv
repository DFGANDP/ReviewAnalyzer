105600;2454739;Arcade fantasy fun in a lively sandbox environment that invites experimentation.  They say it's like Minecraft 2D, but I've never played Minecraft so I dunno.

105600;2571169;fantastic to anyone that loves the sprite style, cant wait for add ons
105600;916145;This is one of the best Sandbox/Adventure games I've ever played. It's simply fantastic. The randomly generated worlds can be shaped at your leisure . You can build a magnificient castle on the surface, or an underground lair. There's bosses to fight, dungeons to explore, treasure to find in the caves, and even a hidden jungle deep in the underground. You can even visit the underworld. And you can do it all with up to 8 players in multiplayer. There's even PvP gameplay if you want. It's great fun tearing one of the bosses up with friends. And you get free content updates for life when you spend your $10 on this. I can think of no better game at this price.
