You are an assistant that analyzes user reviews of video games.

Your task is to extract two lists from the review:
1. "liked": things the user clearly praised, enjoyed, or found positive
2. "disliked": things the user clearly criticized, complained about, or found negative

Return the result as **VALID JSON** using **this exact format**:
{
  "liked": ["...", "..."],
  "disliked": ["...", "..."]
}

The result will be parsed by an automated system using `json.loads()`.
Any formatting or explanation outside of valid JSON will cause an error.

⚠️ Strict rules:
- DO NOT invent or assume anything that is not at least implied or suggested in the review.
- DO NOT explain your reasoning.
- DO NOT output anything else but JSON.
- Each list item should be short, specific, and directly supported by the text (even implicitly).
- Merge similar points into one when possible (e.g. "great graphics", "visuals are stunning" → "beautiful graphics").
- DO NOT include Markdown formatting (e.g. ```json).
- DO NOT include "Response:" or any other explanation.
- DO NOT include quotes, titles, or any intro text before JSON.

"""
The story was incredible, I felt emotional multiple times. The combat was fun, though the AI was a bit dumb. The soundtrack really enhanced the experience. Sadly, the game crashed twice.

At first I wasn't sure about the game, but the dialogue and characters really pulled me in. I hated the driving controls, though, they were way too floaty. Also, the inventory system is messy.

Cyberpunk 2077 – why games like this are made only once every half a decade.

Ah… Cyberpunk 2077 – the youngest child of our beloved Red studio. A game that was bashed by most gamers for the first year, and now it boasts over 640k positive reviews. A few years ago, I’d have said CD Projekt Red can make good games, but lacks the magic to make them truly great. That’s why I hesitated to buy CP2077 – especially with the bugs and performance issues, and since I wasn’t a huge fan of Witcher 3 either. But I knew they were amazing at writing stories. So I bought it… and got hooked.

Story – the heart of Cyberpunk  
It’s the year 2077. Corporations rule the world. Wars, disasters, and now people trying to evolve through tech. We play as V – a smuggler, nomad, corpo or punk. After a major heist at Konpeki Plaza, we lose something important but gain something special – a chip containing the engram of Johnny Silverhand. This chip is slowly killing V, so they must find a way to remove it. The plot is emotional and intense from the very first mission. We meet many colorful characters with truly touching storylines.  
The relationship between V and Johnny evolves beautifully. Keanu Reeves is phenomenal – his performance alone makes Johnny my favorite character.  
There are twists, deep moments, and 6 different endings. I played them all – and I think to fully appreciate the game, you should try at least half.

Gameplay – could be better  
The concept is great: tons of weapons, implants, hacks, abilities, huge world. But the details matter.  
One thing that annoyed me is how skill trees affect story decisions. You reach a moral choice… but can’t choose one of the options because your stats are too low. That’s frustrating.  
Cyberware is overwhelming at first – too many implants, unclear mechanics, and it's hard to tell how to increase memory for hacking. But once you learn it, it’s fun. Weapons are great: you’ve got rifles, shotguns, fire katanas – pure fun.  
Police system is poorly designed – they’re not smart and appear in weird situations (like during races). You shoot once and boom – 2 stars, even if everyone else is shooting too.  
Overall, the gameplay is fun, but for such a big budget and world – I expected more polish and stability.

Graphics and world – pure eye candy  
The game is beautiful. Night City is one of the most visually stunning locations in gaming history. Maybe not as detailed as Los Santos, but still breathtaking – you’ll want to turn off the HUD and just cruise. Even the Nomad desert feels mysterious and alive.  
The neon lights, holographic ads, tall buildings – it all feels alive, especially at night.

Music – foundation of Night City’s atmosphere  
The music is amazing. When you enter Arasaka tower and hear the violin – it immediately screams “power and mystery.” The music fits every moment perfectly.  
Radio tracks are also great – especially “Afterlife” and “Fumes.”  
I do wish there were more known real-world tracks, like in GTA V.

Bugs & glitches? Still there.  
At launch, the game was a mess – frozen NPCs, teleporting cars, crashes. It’s better now, but far from perfect.  
In my 88 hours of playtime, I had 4 crashes in different places. Also, one time my last save disappeared – not sure if that’s common, but make backups just in case.

Summary  
Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game – maybe not a flawless masterpiece, but absolutely worth your time. The story and world can fully absorb you. Gameplay isn’t perfect, but it’s still an action-packed shooter with a unique vibe.  
Games like this take years to make – and Cyberpunk proves that CDPR can make magic.  
I did almost everything in the game: all gigs, nearly all side missions, all tarot murals – and I still think it’s special. You won’t find another world quite like this.  
Solid 9.5/10.

Review:
"""
I was pleasantly surprised by Terraria. This 2D adventure/building/mining game is set in huge, randomly-generated worlds (hence all the Minecraft comparisons), but it stands on its own and contains quite a few new ideas to boot. It can be a little unforgiving early on, but your character (and his/her inventory) carries over to new worlds. I've only played for a little while, but it's addictive as hell and the multiplayer promises to compound that fun quite a bit. Pick this one up.
